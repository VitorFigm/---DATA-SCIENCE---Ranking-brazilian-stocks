<p>We can say, as the result showed an electric sector company as first in the rank, a sector known by its stability, that, for some assets, the result truly shows a quality of the stock. However, how we can see in EALT3, an asset that is despised by the market by its bubble comportment, as its had an exorbitant growth in last years that compensated the fall in the computation of the mean and that was so massive that compensated  even the beta, we can say the result don't show only quality shares.</p>
